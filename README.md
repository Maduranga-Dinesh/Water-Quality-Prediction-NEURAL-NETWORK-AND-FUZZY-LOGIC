# Water-Quality-Prediction-NEURAL-NETWORK-AND-FUZZY-LOGIC

Prediction of water quality is a critical aspect of water pollution control and prevention.
The trend of water quality can be predicted using historical data collected from water quality.
The present study aims to develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and based RNN
(Recursive Neural Network) model to achieve the prediction of water quality in the Kala Oya
river basin. The mini project outcomes demonstrate that the inclusion of
the attention mechanism improves the prediction performance of the LSTM model.

PURPOSE

The purpose is to develop an LSTM and RNN system, considering better and increasingly precise data
to foresee and assess the water quality. Predictive analysis can help to capture relationships among
numerous variables that can help to assess risk with a particular set of conditions.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

There is an assortment of strategies utilized for water quality prediction at Kala Oya river basin using
neural network. I investigated the water quality of the Kala Oya River basin in this study. The system
should accept temperature and rainfall as inputs and outputs are nitrate and the PH value of water

Procedure

linear interpolate method to data pre-processing
Normalized data set.

• Some data is missing for certain years. Can you fill those values?

Yes.

• What methods can be used to fill missing values?

I used Data integration ( ffill, bfillm ffill (0) ) method. Other methods are Data cleaning, Data
reduction, stemming and lemmatization.

• Is it possible to train a Neural Network without the missing values?

Yes.

• Write the parameters used for the most accurate Neural Network trained for this purpose.
